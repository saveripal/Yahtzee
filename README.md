# Yahtzee
A special version of the die game Yahtzee.
Yahtzee is normally played with five, six-sided dice and a scorecard.
One round consists of rolling the dice up to three times, and then filling
one of the categories on the scorecard with a score. The score depends
on both the criteria for the category and the actual dice values, and the
player will normally choose an unfilled category so as to maximize the
resulting score.
In this version of the game, the number of dice, the maximum value on
the dice (i.e., the number of sides), the max number of rolls per round,
and the types of categories on the scorecard, will all be configurable.
